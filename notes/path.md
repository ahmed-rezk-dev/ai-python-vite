#### A lot of courses oversell complexity. What I’ve seen work best for beginners like you is a layered immersion model

    - Phase 1: Learn prompt frameworks + low-code orchestration (Langflow, CrewAI configs)

    - Phase 2: Pick up "functional Python" — just enough to read + tweak agents, not build from scratch

    - Phase 3: Train on agent logic, not just syntax (recursive tasking, tools, memory, etc.)
